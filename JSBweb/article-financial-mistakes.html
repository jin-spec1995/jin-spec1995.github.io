        <article class="prose lg:prose-xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-36 py-12">
            <p>Here in Brisbane, the startup scene is buzzing with energy and innovation. But even the most brilliant business idea can be derailed by simple financial oversights. With over 30 years of experience mentoring local businesses, we've seen the same preventable mistakes appear time and again. Here are five of the most common—and how you can steer clear.</p>

            <h3>1. Confusing Profit with Cash Flow</h3>
            <p>This is the number one killer of new businesses. You can have a profitable business on paper (your invoices show you're earning more than you're spending) but still run out of money. Why? Because profit is theoretical until the cash is actually in your bank account. Long payment terms from clients (e.g., 60 or 90 days) can create a <strong>cash flow gap</strong> that leaves you unable to pay your own bills.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Create a simple <strong>cash flow forecast</strong>. Our "Show Me the Money" workshop focuses heavily on this. It's a spreadsheet that tracks money in and money out, week by week. It forces you to think about <em>when</em> you'll actually be paid, not just when you send an invoice.</p>

            <h3>2. Not Separating Business and Personal Finances</h3>
            <p>When you're starting out, it's tempting to pay for a business expense with a personal card. This quickly becomes a nightmare for bookkeeping and makes it impossible to see if your business is actually financially viable. It also creates major headaches for your accountant at tax time.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> From day one, open a <strong>separate business bank account</strong> and get a business debit or credit card. Treat the business as its own entity. Pay yourself a regular, modest wage from the business account to your personal account instead of dipping in and out randomly.</p>

            <h3>3. Underpricing Your Services or Products</h3>
            <p>Many new entrepreneurs lack the confidence to charge what they're worth. They price their services based on what they *think* the market will bear, rather than what they need to earn to be sustainable and profitable. This is a race to the bottom that you can't win.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Do the maths. Calculate your total costs (including your own salary), add a realistic <strong>profit margin</strong> (e.g., 20-30%), and then determine your pricing. Understand your <strong>value proposition</strong>—if you provide a superior service, you can charge a premium price.</p>

            <h3>4. Neglecting to Forecast and Budget</h3>
            <p>Many business owners fly blind, reacting to financial situations as they happen rather than planning for them. Without a budget or a forecast, you have no way of knowing if you're on track, if you can afford that new hire, or how a quiet month might impact your cash reserves.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Build a simple <strong>annual budget</strong>. Estimate your sales month by month and your fixed and variable costs. This doesn't need to be perfect, but it creates a benchmark. Review your actual performance against your budget every month to stay in control.</p>

            <h3>5. Ignoring Key Financial Metrics</h3>
            <p>You don't need to be an accountant, but you do need to understand a few key numbers in your business. Ignoring metrics like <strong>Gross Profit Margin</strong>, <strong>Net Profit Margin</strong>, and <strong>Customer Acquisition Cost</strong> means you're making decisions based on gut feel rather than data.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Create a simple <strong>"scorecard"</strong> with 3-5 key metrics that are most important for your business. Track them weekly or monthly. This is a core part of our "Big Picture" strategic planning process—turning your goals into numbers you can actually measure.</p>

            <p>Avoiding these common pitfalls can dramatically increase your chances of success. Financial literacy isn't about complex accounting; it's about building simple, consistent habits that give you clarity and control.</p>
